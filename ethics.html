        <p> Human life is the means to get rid of the cycle of birth and death, old age and travel. Devotion and liberation are
             possible in this life. Only in the human body, a person can reach God by knowing his form.
            We have forgotten the purpose for which life was given. A common man is born crying. He is living in the run-up of 
            money-accumulation, 
            enjoyment, worries, problems, relationships and desires. While straightening
             life, it passes away. In the end, repenting and crying, we leave the world. A priceless diamond is lost instead of being born. 
                time means and power. They remove life from bad company, bad thinking, faults and evils and brings it 
                 on the right path. It is a boon of God to humans that whenever they want to be careful, improve and
                rise up they can rise. For this, willpower, determination, effort and dedication are required.
            Understanding this is vital.</p>
